# Creating a Project

Most tutorials involving React encourage you to use a program called
`create-react-app` when you're starting out. I **STRONGLY** discourage this
approach because it hides everything "until you're ready". Except you're
_never_ ready for all the things it hides, then you end up with a production
app running off `create-react-app` and you wonder why your performance is
terrible and your boss complains that React is a terrible framework and that
you shouldn't use it anymore.

So let's not go down that path. We'll do what everyone else does instead:
Create an empty project and copy working files and ignore their contents!

If you're following this tutorial, you've already succeeded! This tutorial
contains a minimal working React app with all the plumbing already set up!
